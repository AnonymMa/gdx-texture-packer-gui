Simple utility to help you pack and manage texture atlases for [LibGDX game framework](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).
It's mostly just visual wrapper over [LibGDX TexturePacker classes](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/tree/master/extensions/gdx-tools/src/com/badlogic/gdx/tools/texturepacker)
and offers more convenient way of using it.

This project is a successor of [Aurelien Ribon's project](github.com/aurelienRibon/libgdx-texturepacker-gui) with whole new GUI and features.

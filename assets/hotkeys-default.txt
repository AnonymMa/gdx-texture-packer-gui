# This is a default hotkey list.
#
# Lines started with "#" are comments.
#
# One expression per line. Syntax is "[operation_name]:[shortcut_definition]".
# Shortcut definition may contain any number of modifiers in any order
# and only one any other key connected by plus(+) character.
# Available modifiers (keys from the one group are self-interchangeable and should be treated as the same key):
#   SHIFT
#   ALT
#   CTRL, CONTROL
#   CMD, COMMAND, SUPER, META, WIN, WINDOWS
#
# You can create your custom shortcut file with different keys. Place it into the application directory
# (next to "gdx-texturepacker.jar" location) and name the file "hotkeys.txt".

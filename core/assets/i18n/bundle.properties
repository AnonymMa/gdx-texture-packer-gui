psTtPot = If checked, output pages will have power of two dimensions.
psTtPaddingX = The number of pixels between packed images on the x-axis.
psTtPaddingY = The number of pixels between packed images on the y-axis.
psTtBleed = If checked, RGB values for transparent pixels are set based on the RGB values of the nearest non-transparent pixels. This prevents filtering artifacts when RGB values are sampled for transparent pixels.
psTtEdgePadding = If checked, half of the paddingX and paddingY will be used around the edges of the packed texture.
psTtDuplicatePadding = If checked, edge pixels are copied into the padding. paddingX/Y should be >= 2.
psTtRotation = If checked, TexturePacker will attempt more efficient packing by rotating images 90 degrees. Applications must take special care to draw these regions properly.
psTtMinWidth = The minimum width of output pages.
psTtMinHeight = The minimum height of output pages.
psTtMaxWidth = The maximum width of output pages. 2048 is safe for most devices.
psTtMaxHeight = The maximum height of output pages. 2048 is safe for most devices.
psTtSquare = If checked, output pages are forced to have the same width and height.
psTtStripWhitespaceX = If checked, blank pixels on the left and right edges of input images will be removed. Applications must take special care to draw these regions properly.
psTtStripWhitespaceY = If checked, blank pixels on the top and bottom edges of input images will be removed. Applications must take special care to draw these regions properly.
psTtAlphaThreshold = Alpha values below this are treated as zero when whitespace is stripped.
psTtFilterMin = The minification filter for the texture.
psTtFilterMag = The magnification filter for the texture.
psTtWrapX = The wrap setting in the x direction for the texture.
psTtWrapY = The wrap setting in the y direction for the texture.
psTtFormat = The format the texture will use in-memory.
psTtAlias = If checked, two images that are pixel for pixel the same will only be packed once.
psTtOutputFormat = The image type for output pages, "png" or "jpg".
psTtJpegQuality = The quality setting if output format is "jpg".
psTtIgnoreBlankImages = If checked, texture packer won't add regions for completely blank images.
psTtFast = If checked, the texture packer will not pack as efficiently but will execute much faster.
psTtDebug = If checked, lines are drawn on the output pages to show the packed image bounds.
psTtCombineSubdirectories = If checked, the directory containing all subdirectories are packed as if they were in the same directory.
psTtFlattenPaths = If checked, subdirectory prefixes are stripped from image file names. Image file names should be unique.
psTtPremultiplyAlpha = If checked, the RGB will be multiplied by the alpha. See here for more information.
psTtUseIndexes = If false, image names are used without stripping any image index suffix.
psTtLimitMemory = If checked, only one image is in memory at any given time, but each image will be read twice. If false, all images are kept in memory during packing but are only read once.
psTtGrid = If checked, images are packed in a uniform grid, in order.
psTtScale = For each scale, the images are scaled and an entire atlas is output.
psTtScaleSuffix = For each scale, the suffix to use for the output files. If omitted, files for multiple scales will be output with the same name to a subdirectory for each scale.
